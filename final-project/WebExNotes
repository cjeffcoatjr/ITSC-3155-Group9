Demo 1 should have:

	Some basic models: Context Diagram, Usecase Diagram, Some Uses, etc.
	A short demo video of the developed prototype
	Test scenarios that we will be, or already are, testing

3 scrums a week including the 2 during class:

	What did we do?
	What happened?
	What's next?
		These three questions will be maintained and answered each Scrum in a Google Doc, shared with the team.

Task #1 each day is to update the Project Tracker Sheet. 
Task #2 is to plan for the next meeting.
